# Puzzle 8 Solver

This project implements a solver for the classic 8-puzzle game using various search algorithms in C# and WPF. It allows users to input an initial puzzle state and solve it using Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and a heuristic-based approach (such as A*).

## Features

- **User Interface:** Built with WPF, allowing users to visualize the puzzle board.
- **Search Algorithms:** Implements BFS, DFS, and heuristic-based search for solving the puzzle.
- **Step Tracking:** Displays the number of steps taken for each algorithm.
- **State Validation:** Ensures the puzzle input is valid (contains unique numbers from 0 to 8).
- **Board Updates:** Displays the intermediate and final states for each solution approach.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/VeraTaras/8-Puzzle-Solver.git
```
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Open the solution file (`Puzzle8.sln`) in Visual Studio.
4. Build and run the application.

## Usage

1. **Enter Initial State:** Input the numbers 0-8 in a valid configuration.
2. **Apply Sequence:** Click the "Apply" button to validate and set the board.
3. **Solve the Puzzle:** Choose an algorithm (BFS, DFS, Heuristic) and run the solver.

4. **View Results:** The solved state and the number of steps taken will be displayed.
